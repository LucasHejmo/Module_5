# Module_5

The analysis in this repository was completed as part of a data analysis course. The core structure and requirements of the analysis were provided by the course materials. The implementation of the code, including data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization, was done by Lucas Hejmo.

The basic structure of the data loading and merging process was provided in the course materials.

The method for calculating summary statistics using groupby and agg functions was inspired by the pandas documentation (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/).

The outlier detection method using IQR was based on a common statistical technique, with implementation guidance from the SciPy documentation (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html).

The visualization techniques, including bar plots, pie charts, box plots, and scatter plots, were implemented using Matplotlib, with reference to the Matplotlib documentation (https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html).

The correlation and linear regression analysis was performed using SciPy, with reference to its documentation (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html).

All code implementation, data interpretation, and conclusions drawn are my own work unless otherwise specified.

The complete code for this analysis can be found in the pymaceuticals_analysis_finished.ipynb Jupyter notebook in this repository.
